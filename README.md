# Trivia-Game
A basic console based Trivia Game.

Trivia Game – In this question you will create a simple trivia game for two players. The program will work like
this:
     Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering five trivia questions. (There are a total of 10
    questions.) When a question is displayed, four possible answers are also displayed. Only one of the answers
    is correct, and if the player selects the correct answer he or she earns a point.
     After answers have been selected for all of the questions, the program displays the number of points earned
    by each player and declares the player with the highest number of points the winner.
    
In this program you will design a Question class to hold the data for a trivia question. . You will need to write three
files (Question.h, Question.cpp and Q2.cpp). The Question class should have member variables for the following data:
A trivia question

    • Possible answer #1
    • Possible answer #2
    • Possible answer #3
    • Possible answer #4
    • The number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)
The Question class should have appropriate constructor(s), accessor, and mutator functions. The program should
create an array of 10 Question objects, one for each trivia question. Make up your own trivia questions on the subject
or subjects of your choice for the objects.
